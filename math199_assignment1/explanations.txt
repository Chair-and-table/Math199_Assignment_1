L = 5, k = 4

When the initial population of the rabbits is 0.2 kilo-rabbits, the population growth starts rather slow, however, it eventually speeds up and reaches its inflection 
point, or maximum growth,  at around t = 0.8. It then slows down and converges towards 5 kilo-rabbits, which is the carrying capacity L. 
When the initial population of the rabbits is 2 kilo-rabbits, the maximum population growth is at t = 0, but there are no inflection points as the graph's curvature is
always negative. Again, the graph appears to converge to 5 kilo-rabbits.
When the initial population of the rabbits is 8 kilo-rabbits, the graph begins with a rapid decrease.
There is no maximum population growth because the graph is always decreasing and there is no inflection point for the 
same reason. Unlike the other graphs which converge to 5 kilo-rabbits from the bottom, this one converges to it from the top. 
One thing to note is that these solutions are not fully representative of real life, as while they capture the expected convergence on a population value and so so 

the slow initial growth at small values,
